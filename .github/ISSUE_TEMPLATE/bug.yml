        ### Pre-Bug Report Checklist
        - I've reviewed the documentation and examples
        - I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling `node_modules`, (`package-lock.json`, `yarn-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yml`)
        - I've reviewed existing [Bug Reports](https://github.com/9mbs/calendar-widgets/labels/bug) and have verified my issue is new

        ### Please include as many of the following details in your bug report as possible
        - `calendar-widgets` version number in your project
        -  Screenshot of error(s)
        - What platforms are you seeing this error on? (e.g. desktop, mobile, native, etc)
        - If using a browser, what browsers are you seeing this error on? (Please list all)
        - Do you have a way for us to recreate your environment? (e.g a public repo we can clone and test?)
        - Please list any additional details in your report that might help us narrow down the root cause of the issue you're experiencing.
