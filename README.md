## Getting Started

To begin, you'll want to add the `calendar-widgets` package to a new or existing React project.

```sh
# npm
npm install calendar-widgets

# yarn
yarn add calendar-widgets

# pnpm
pnpm add calendar-widgets
```

## Examples

To help you get started, take a look at this simple implementation of a Calendar. Here we're overriding the default component used to display a particular date with our custom variation.

We're also passing an array of custom dates. When the custom date's `date` aligns with the `date` in our `CustomDay` component, we'll have access to that custom date.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Calendar } from 'calendar-widgets';
import 'calendar-widgets/styles/Calendar-grid.css';

/* defining an optional custom day component */
const CustomDay = ({date, customDate}) => (
  <div>
    <b>{date.getDate()}</b>
    {customDate?.name && <small>{customDate?.name}</small>}
  </div>
);

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Calendar 
      customDay={CustomDay}
      customDates={[
        {
          name: 'Lisa\'s Birthday',
          date: new Date(2023, 4, 10)
        }
        // ...
      ]}
    />
  )
};
```
