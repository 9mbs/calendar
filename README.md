## Getting Started

**‚ö†Ô∏è Under active development ‚ö†Ô∏è**

To begin, install the [`calendar-widgets`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/calendar-widgets) package from the NPM Registry. **You'll also need to ensure you have React setup in your development environment.**

```shell
# npm
npm install calendar-widgets

# yarn
yarn add calendar-widgets

# pnpm
pnpm install calendar-widgets
```

### Calendar
Just a simple calendar. You can style the the day component as you'd prefer. 

```jsx
import {Calendar} from 'calendar-widgets';

// ...
<Calendar 
  year={2021}
  month={1}
  day={1}
  dayComponent={({ date }) => (
    <div>
      {date.getDate()}
    </div>
  )}}
/>
```

### DraggableDay
The DraggableDay component is a React-based calendar interface that allows users to drag and drop events between different days in the calendar. It uses native HTML5 drag and drop functionality and custom React event handlers for a smooth and responsive user experience.

```jsx
import {DraggableDay} from 'calendar-widgets';

<DraggableDay
  startRow={"7am"}
  endRow={"5pm"}
  initialDraggables={[
    {
      id: 1,
      position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
      height: 1,
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      position: { x: 0, y: 50 },
      height: 1,
    },
  ]}
/>
```

## Context

**Setup**

Before you're able to use the hooks within the `useCalendarWidgetsContext` api, you'll want to wrap your app in the `CalendarWidgetsProvider` context provider. 

_Parent.jsx_
```jsx
import {CalendarWidgetsProvider} from 'calendar-widgets';
import MyCustomCalendarComponent from './MyCustomCalendarComponent';

// ...
<CalendarWidgetsProvider>
  <MyCustomCalendarComponent />
</CalendarWidgetsProvider>
```

_MyCustomCalendarComponent.jsx_
```jsx
import {useCalendarWidgetsContext} from 'calendar-widgets'

//..
const {draggableDay, setDraggableDay} = useCalendarWidgetsContext();
```

If this isn't setup properly, you'll see this error message:

```sh
useCalendarWidgetsContext must be used within a CalendarWidgetsProvider
```
