## Getting Started

**Under active development**

To begin, install the [`calendar-widgets`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/calendar-widgets) package from the NPM Registry.

```shell
# npm
npm install calendar-widgets

# yarn
yarn add calendar-widgets

# pnpm
pnpm install calendar-widgets
```

Once the package is installed, you'll have access to an array of helpers and utilities that do a lot of the heavy lifting when it comes to dates and calendars. 

### Helpers
- [`listCalendarYear`](https://calendar-widgets.com/helpers/listCalendarYear) function
- [`listDaysInMonth`](https://calendar-widgets.com/helpers/listDaysInMonth) function
- `listLocalizedMonths` function

### Utilities
- [`formatDate`](https://calendar-widgets.com/utilities/formatDate) function
- [`getDaysInMonth`](https://calendar-widgets.com/utilities/getDaysInMonth) function
- [`isValidDay`](https://calendar-widgets.com/utilities/isValidDay) function
- [`isValidYear`](https://calendar-widgets.com/utilities/isValidYear) function
- [`isValidMonth`](https://calendar-widgets.com/utilities/isValidMonth) function

## Local Setup 
This project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) to be installed. You can install them from Node.js website and pnpm website.

To begin, clone the repository then run the following commands:

```shell
# install root project dependencies

From there, you may want to refer to the [this repo](#this-repo) section for further navigation. If you're looking to contribute to the actual `calendar-widgets` code, you'll likely want to run your build commands from the [`/workspaces/tests`](./workspaces/tests/README.md) directory to ensure nothing is breaking.
